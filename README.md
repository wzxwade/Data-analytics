## Introduction
* Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. This dataset contains historical usage patterns with weather and time data in order to forecast bike using rate in a city. We built classification model and regression model respectively in order to predict the busy hours of bike usage and predict the specific number of riders. The purpose of this project is to help bike share company reduce cost incurred through bike dispatch and increase customer retain rate by offering a better service.

## Problem description 
* Bike share programs becomes popular recently, but for bike share companies, it may be a difficult problem that how to operate their bikes in an effective way. In order to better understanding their customer and provide a better service, there are several important problems for bike share companies. For example, what is the time that customers are most likely to ride; what is the weather that customers are most likely to ride; when should companies provide more bikes in a city; etc.  
For classification model, we want to find out that for a given time whether the bike will be heavily used, so bikes company can plan to offer more bikes during this time. For regression model, firstly, we want to use regression model to explain the key factor that may influence the usage of bike. We can also   use the regression model to predict the specific number of riders in a given condition.
